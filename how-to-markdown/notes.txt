 ### What is Markdown?

  First things first, let's consider what Markdown actually is.

  Markdown - is a lightweight, easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format
  for styling all forms of writing around the Internet. Markdown helps to
  control the display of the document: formatting words as bold or italic,
  adding images, creating lists and so on.

  Markdown was made by [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/) in 2004,
  with significant collaboration from [Aaron
  Swartz](http://www.aaronsw.com/).

  Markdown can be written in a basic text editor. It's an easy way to write
  text that easily translates into HTML. When you write in Markdown, you
  have to save the document with the .md or .markdown extensions.

  We can use Markdown almost everywhere:

   » StackOverflow uses Markdown for posts and comments.
   » GitHub uses Markdown for discussions in issues and pull requests.
   » Reddit uses Markdown for formatting comments.
   » Slack, Gitter and other IM use Markdown for formatting messages.
   » Jekyll, Octopress, Hexo and other static site tools use Markdown.
   » GitBook uses Markdown for writing books.
   » Many people prefer to use Markdown for writing their blogs.
   » Documentations for many open source project are written in Markdown.
   » how-to-markdown also uses Markdown for formatting exercises.

  So, knowledge of Markdown is an important skill for modern developers.
  That's why you have to learn it.

 ### How to get Markdown?

  There is no clearly defined Markdown standard. Markdown is just common
  rules on how to write readable and formatted text.

  While Markdown is a minimal markup language and is easily read and edited
  with a normal text editor, there's no need in specially designed editors
  for writing files in Markdown. However, there are a few editors that
  preview the files with styles.

  Implementations of Markdown are available for over a dozen programming
  languages (JavaScript, Ruby, Python, PHP, Perl, etc). In addition, many
  platforms and frameworks support Markdown out of the box. For example,
  Markdown plugins exist for every major blogging platform.

 ### How to use this workshopper?

  It's easy to use this workshopper. In most cases, it's enough to use these
  three commands for interacting with this workshopper:

   » how-to-markdown run file.md will serve a local server at
     http://localhost:3000/ with a preview of file.md.
   » how-to-markdown verify file.md will verify your file.
   » how-to-markdown help shows a help message.

 ## THE CHALLENGE

  You first challenge is pretty simple. Just create a new file (for example
  using touch) and add a single line:

     Hello, world!

  If you already did this, run how-to-markdown verify to verify your
  solution or how-to-markdown run to run your file in the browser.

 ## HEADINGS (Exercise 2 of 12)

  It's important to categorize information. That's when headings come to
  help us.

  If you need to add a heading just type a # sign. The amount of # is a
  level of heading. For example:

     # Heading 1
     ## Heading 2
     ### Heading 3
     #### Heading 4
     ##### Heading 5
     ###### Heading 6

  As in HTML, there is 6 levels of headings. This headings will be
  transformed into <h1>-<h6> tags accordingly.

  There are aliases for first- and second-level headings. You can type a
  three dashes (-) right on the next line for creating a second-level
  heading. If you type three equality signs, then you will get a first-level
  heading. Example:

     Heading 2
     ===

     Heading 2
     ---

 ## THE CHALLENGE

  Please create a first-level heading with Markdown is awesome! and then
  verify your solution.

 ## EMPHASIS (Exercise 3 of 12)

  It's easy to mark text as italic, bold, combined and strikethrough. There
  are a few ways to make emphasis in Markdown and each of those is readable.

  To get emphasis just wrap some text in single, double or triple asterisks
  (*) or underscores (_). Here are some examples:

     Italics with *asterisks* and _underscores_.

  |> Italics with asterisks and underscores.

     Bold with **asterisks** or __underscores__

  |> Bold with asterisks or underscores

     Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

  |> Combined emphasis with asterisks and underscores.

  Sometimes you need to draw line through the text. To get strikethrough
  wrap the text in two tildes (~) like so:

     ~~Scratch this line.~~

  |> Scratch this line.

 ## THE CHALLENGE

  Create a new file and add a first-level heading at the top of your file.
  This heading should contain Emphasis as text.

  Below the heading, add this text:

     It's very easy to use italic, bold and combined emphasis in Markdown!

  Please, mark italic, bold and combined using relevant styles.
