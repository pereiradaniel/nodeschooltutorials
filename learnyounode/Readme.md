# Learnyounode Solutions :innocent:

These are my solutions for the Learnyounode tutorial available [here][LearnyounodeLink].  In the comments, there are several solutions and the official solution.  The blog posts have reference links to the relevant Node and Javascript docs.


# Who will this help? :smile:

The Learnyounode tutorial is a very good introduction for beginner or expert web developers.  A prior knowledge of Javascript is required.  Nodeschool also has a good Javascripting tutorial available on their [page][javascriptingLink].  Another good Javascript resource can be found at [w3schools.com][javascriptW3].
